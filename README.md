# ALGORITHMS

People tend to think that learning algorithms requires some great 
mathematical skill! In fact, it just requires a basic understanding of
logic. Simple put, an algorithm is just a set of instructions. It is 
breaking down a large task into its most basic parts.

I wrote these in PHP, but they are simplified and will pretty much work
in any language. Or, they can be used to learn a new language.

If you have any ideas or want to contribute, just clone the repo
and send a pull request. I will continue to add more periodically.
